        <p> Whenever I get back down to Santa Cruz, and around to taking pictures of my completed machining projects, I'll put them here. </p>

        <p> I was trained on the Bridgeport (non-computerized) mill, in the SCIPP machine shop, once I graduated (something about undergraduates using dangerous machinery). I was taught by Forest Martinez-McKinney, an ATLAS strips guy, who I hold a deep appreciation for. If you ever get the chance, swing by the SCIPP lab room and ask him about, well, anything really. A true joy of a fellow.</p>

        <p> Forest also started to train me on the lathe, but I still have much to learn before I understand it's capabilities. I guess there is a lot to learn with the manual mill as well.</p>
