        <p> <i> Updated March 17th, 2025 </i></p>
        
        <p> Most recently, in my first semester at Berkeley, I rotated in Professor Oskar Hallatschek's lab, building microfluidic devices.  </p>
        
        <p>The brunt of my research experience was under the tutelage of Professor Michael Hance, of UCSC, and of SCIPP Atlas Pixels. An excellent teacher,
            and a wonderful PI, my two(ish) years working for him has been my most rewarding work. The majority of my work for ATLAS concerned developing
            the testing setups for Pixel modules, the smallest sensors in the ATLAS experiment. </p>
        
        <p> The summer of my first year of undergraduate study at UCSC was when I first investigated research possibilities. In the sunny front yard of the
            college-boy filled house I lived in, I attended an undergraduate research fair (thanks Gray!). Shortly thereafter, I started some data analysis
            work for the VERITAS experiment. I didn't find what I was looking for, there, but I did enjoy writing some elementary linux-automation software. </p>
