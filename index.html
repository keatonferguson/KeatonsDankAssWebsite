			<h1>Surveillance</h1>
			<p>    In class, we watched two short films, Blaxites and FRAMES, both of which had strong themes regarding privacy. Blaxites focused on privacy online, particularly the privacy of social media posts, whereas FRAMES focused on privacy in public spaces. Both shorts showed a realistic view of what surveillance could be like in the future.
   In Blaxites, there were there major moments where the privacy that people thought they had come into question: when Jai’s friend is sent Caffeine pills by an advertisement company, when Jai is labeled as non-compliant to her Lorazepam prescription for posting a photo of her drinking online, and when her prescription is canceled for getting Lorazepam from another source. This short shows the trade-offs people agree to when using online services. These companies, specifically google and facebook in this case, can provide social media platforms and search engines for free by running advertisements and data collection. Facebook analyses text and images posted by the user, as well as friends and family to collect data to sell to advertisers (https://www.datamation.com/big-data/facebook-and-data-mining.html). Google similarly sells search and location history to these advertisers to make their revenue (https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/google-data-collection-is-more-extensive-and-intrusive-than-you-ever-imagined/). The trade-off for using these free services is that the user gives them permission to collect and sell their data; However, with google specifically there is almost no choice to opt-out. There are other choices of a search engine, such as Firefox, but nearly 10 million websites use google hosted libraries, 1.5 billion people use Gmail, and 76% of smartphones use android. To avoid giving data to Google, you would need to avoid the websites that use its libraries, android phones, and avoid sending emails to people who use Gmail. (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/08/when-it-comes-to-internet-privacy-be-very-afraid-analyst-suggests/). If you are interested in seeing the data Google has on you, you can download it by following this guide. While most of this data is only seen by an algorithm, it’s still not safe from human eyes. The recent Facebook data hacks show that the personal data being held by these is not fully protected. (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html)</p> 
   <p><br>     In FRAMES, the subject is tracked by numerous cameras, each with a database of information on her and the ability to see everything she does from the information on her phone to her transaction data. These cameras seem to function similarly to CCTV cameras. These are security cameras placed by police agencies in public areas to deter crimes and help track criminals. These systems have been deployed in urban areas such as Chicago, Washington D.C., and London. These cameras constantly record what happens and allow law enforcement to playback the footage, which has led to numerous concerns including the effectiveness and possible abuse of the cameras. While CCTV cameras do track a lot of people, they are not able to provide detailed information on the people in frame. Police still need to investigate them manually, however, a lot of the information shown by the cameras in the short is relatively easy for authorities to obtain. In 2014 a woman named Lisa Roberts was falsely arrested for murder when police used location data gathered without a warrant from her cell phone to link her to the crime. (https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-your-cell-phone-cant-tell-the-police) There have been similar cases where police seize text messages without a warrant to use as evidence. This has been changing recently, in Carpenter vs. United States the Supreme Court ruled that police need a warrant to access any information stored on cell phones, so it may be possible to avoid the level of surveillance FRAMES shows.

   <p> <br>    Surveillance and privacy have become an important topic in sociology as methods of mass surveillance have become more feasible and prevalent as technology advances. Vida Bajc is one sociologist that focuses on security and surveillance. In her article Debating Surveillance in an Age of Security Vida discusses the causes of government surveillance on citizens, methods of surveillance, and how these developments threaten citizen-state relationship
(https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764207305148). Similarly, Sarah Brayne analyses how big data analytics have amplified surveillance practices and the consequences of big data surveillance and predictive policing based on data on inequality in her article Big Data Surveillance (https://www.asanet.org/big-data-surveillance-case-policing). The overall census on surveillance is split between an optimistic view believing that surveillance technology is necessary for public safety, and a pessimistic view that fears the surveillance technology is inhumane and untrustworthy, with a majority having views on the pessimistic view.</p>
